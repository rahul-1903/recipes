Making chicken is very easy task.
First you need to marinate the chicken with curd, salt, and turmeric powder.
Fry oil in a pan.
Take chopped onion in the pan when the oil is heated and fry it till the onion turns brown.
Add spices in different quantities and fry it.
Add salt as per your tast. I would prefer about 1 tablespoon for about 800gm of chicken.
